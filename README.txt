**This code is incomplete. Spatial correction should be added. 
For now, it is an unconstrained correlation of the windowed time series

The code has sensor object constructors for 9 stations written in, change this for your array.

For each ring, coherance is calculated by the sensor objects you pass to it. 
Currently set up for 3 rings with 3, 6, and 6 sensors as the rings move out:
change for use case.
